        ReHome is a software system designed as an online marketplace for buying and selling used
        furniture, providing a specialized platform to connect local buyers and sellers.
        The system allows sellers to create detailed listings, including photos, descriptions,
        and pricing, making it easy to showcase furniture items. Buyers can browse these listings
        with advanced filtering options, such as location, price range, condition, and furniture type,
        to find exactly what they need. A key feature of ReHome is its emphasis on security and trust,
        offering integrated payment protection and potentially escrow services to ensure safe and
        reliable transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. In addition to the buying and selling process,
        ReHome introduces unique features to improve the user experience, such as a virtual room placement
        tool that allows buyers to visualize how the furniture would look in their home. This system
        addresses the shortcomings of general-purpose platforms by focusing on the specific needs of the
        used furniture market, making it easier, safer, and more efficient for users to buy and sell items.

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
        There are 2 main types of intended users for the ReHome platform. One type of user would be the
        sellers who are interested in selling their furniture to others. The second are users who are
        interested in buying used furniture from safe sellers in their area. Below we examine the most
        common usage scenario for each target user.

        <h3>Joey's Fresh Start</h3>
        <p>
            Joey is a senior in his last semester of college. He has been living alone in his apartment
            close to his university for the past 3 years. Joey is planning on moving to a different state
            after graduation for his new job. Since he plans to move so far away from his current city,
            Joey wants to start selling some of the furniture in his apartment before he moves out. He
            needs to be able to do the following using ReHome:
        </p>

        <p class="abList">1. List his furniture for sale on the platform</p>
        <p class="abList">2. Add specific details about his sale to the listing, such as price, furniture measurements,
            photos, and more </p>
        <p class="abList">3. Message potential buyers who are interested in any of his furniture pieces</p>
        <p class="abList">4. Be able to vet/get assurance that the buyer he chooses is a real person and not a scammer</p>
        <p class="abList">5. Safely complete the sale and have the money transferred over to him securely via the platform</p>

        <p>
            Joey’s ultimate goal is to be able to sell his furniture to real people in his areas without
            fears that potential buyers are scammers who are trying to waste his time.

        <h3>Rachel on a Budget</h3>
        <p>
            Rachel is finishing up her first year at university. She has secured an apartment for the upcoming
            school year and is planning to move in the week after the semester has ended. Rachel is a full
            time student and does not have the money to buy expensive, new furniture. She also does not
            have a car, so she wants to be able to find furniture listings close to her new apartment so
            she can have a friend help carry it over. As a result, she would like to use ReHome to find
            affordable used furniture for her new apartment. Rachel wants a platform that allows her to do
            the following:
        </p>

        <p class="abList">1. Search for furniture for sale on the platform</p>
        <p class="abList">2. Filter for specific details such as the type of furniture, the colors, the price range, and more </p>
        <p class="abList">3. Message potential sellers to ask about the price, when the item will be available for pickup, and
            other purchase details</p>
        <p class="abList">4. Be able to vet/get assurance that the seller she chooses is a real person and not a scammer</p>
        <p class="abList">5. Safely transfer the money with a cash back guarantee that she can get her money back in the case of a
            scam</p>

        <p>
            In the end, Rachel hopes to find some good quality furniture pieces from other locals without a
            fear of being scammed by people who claim to have furniture for sale but just end up taking her
            money.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below is an example of how Rachel can search for furniture on ReHome’s interface. She can scroll
            through the listings and select any of them if she chooses for more information.

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

    <p><strong>NFR-1: Performance</strong>: ReHome should efficiently handle high volumes of concurrent users browsing,
        listing, and completing transactions. Listings on ReHome must load within 2 seconds, and images should upload in
        under 5 seconds to ensure a smooth experience for both buyers and sellers.</p>

    <p><strong>NFR-2: Scalability</strong>: ReHome must be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users,
        listings, and transactions. As ReHome grows, it should continue to function smoothly, even during spikes in
        traffic, such as special sales or promotions.</p>

    <p><strong>NFR-3: Security</strong>: ReHome must prioritize user data security by implementing secure authentication
        mechanisms, encrypting sensitive information such as payment details, and ensuring compliance with data
        protection laws like GDPR. ReHome must also include fraud prevention features and safeguards for safe
        transactions. ReHome also verifies the identities of every user to ensure they are real people and not
        impersonating anyone.</p>

    <p><strong>NFR-4: Availability</strong>: ReHome must maintain high availability, ensuring at least 99.9% uptime. In

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">High Level Design</h2>
    <p>
        Our team chose to use a microservice architecture to develop our application. In this design, the business
        logic is separated into microservices that handle different functions within the app. This overall design can
        be separated into tiers.
    </p>
    <div class="imagesCentered">
        <img src="clientDiagram.png" class="diagram">
    </div>
    <p>
        The first tier is the client tier. The client is the frontend layer and will contain the mobile application and
        its user interface. The client will send users requests to the server in the form of API calls and display the
        responses from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second tier is the API. The API will delegate the requests received from the client to the appropriate
        microservice. It will then pass the results of these tasks back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third and final tier is the data tier. This backend layer will contain the database servers that store and
        manage data. Each microservice will have its own private database. The application server will use a relational
        database, like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

                <p>2. If not, the user must enter their preferred payment method information.</p>
                <p>3. ReHome will use an external tool such as Plaid to verify the payment method is valid.</p>
                <p>4. The buyer must navigate to the message chat with the intended seller and press the “Request Money”
                    button located in the menu of the chat if they decide to make an electronic payment.</p>
                <p>5. If both the buyer and seller agree that a cash payment is acceptable for the listing, the buyer
                    can mark “Sale Completed” in the listing once they have received the cash.</p>
                <p>6. The buyer must enter the agreed-upon amount of money and press “Request.”</p>
                <p>7. The seller receives the request payment and can select the “Pay Amount” button to transfer the

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">Design Rational</h2>

    <p>
        ReHome is a platform that involves implementing particular approaches to its architecture in order to properly
        enact responses to user input. Each component is designed to help achieve a specific function of the platform.
        The following design decisions explain the technical aspects of ReHome’s system, and the justification describes
        how these key design decisions relate to each of the modules.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Design Decisions</h3>

    <p><strong> 1. Microservices Architecture </strong></p>

    <p>Design Decision: ReHome can be broken down into multiple microservices for each function. This will promote
        modularity in the system and allow for components to be independent, but work together. This is a type of
        modular architecture.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements Met:</strong></p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Functional:</strong> A microservices architecture can help meet many of the functional
        requirements as there can be microservices for each of them. These requirements include FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4,
        FR-6, FR-7, and FR-8. There can be separate microservices for user accounts, buying furniture, making listings,
        filter queries, payment processing, messaging, and the feedback system. While all of these will be separate
        components, they can work together as a user navigates through the ReHome platform.</p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Non-Functional:</strong> This meets the NFR-2 scalability requirement, as it allows for
        resource optimization. As more users join the platform, the architecture will be able to handle the increased
        load. It also meets the NFR-3 requirement of security, as each microservice can have its own security measures.
        Microservices can help with redundancy, which supports availability in NFR-4. It addresses NFR-7 as
        microservices can be developed with various technologies, allowing for compatibility. This decision meets NFR-11
        and NFR-8 as any issues that can occur can be linked back to the specific microservice, and can be addressed
        without affecting the others. It also meets NFR-6 as it allows for easy maintainability in a modular
        architecture. Finally, a microservices architecture addresses the legal compliance requirement of NFR-10 as
        every microservice can be designed to comply with the necessary regulations.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Relational SQL Database</strong></p>

    <p>Design Decision: A relational SQL database is the best choice for this platform to store information about
        listings. There can be initial databases to store user information, currently open listings, photos, and
        closed/sold listings.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements Met:</strong></p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Functional:</strong> This design will help meet multiple functional requirements. A
        relational database can store user information and their transactional history, and help with account
        authentication and recovery, meeting FR-1 and FR-7. It meets FR-2 by providing the ability to store listing
        information in a database. FR-6 and FR-8 are met as there can be separate databases for messages and feedback
        information. FR-3 is met as SQL queries allow for filtering. It addresses FR-4.1 specifically since payment
        information can be stored in its own database.</p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Non-Functional:</strong> Relational databases can scale over time, achieving NFR-2 of
        scalability. It can also help address the security requirement in NFR-3, as SQL databases allow for encryption.
        It can also provide reliability, which is NFR-8, by helping keep data consistent throughout the databases.
        Finally, this design also helps meet NFR-10 of legal compliance, as data management practices can help support
        compliance.</p>

    <hr style="width: 95%; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; justify-content: center; display: flex;">

    <p><strong>3. Hand-held Augmented Reality</strong></p>

    <p>Design Decision: Using hand-held augmented reality will allow users to take advantage of ReHome’s Virtual Room
        Placement Tool. A 3D digital model of the furniture is combined with the physical room to visualize the
        piece.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements Met:</strong></p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Functional:</strong> The main purpose of using hand-held augmented reality in ReHome is to
        support the virtual room placement service. Therefore, the main requirement it meets is the FR-5 requirement of
        allowing the user to visually see the furniture in the room, and choose to save the placement if required.</p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Non-Functional:</strong> This helps achieve NFR-1 as it allows for good performance by
        quickly loading the data and helping visualize the furniture in real life. It also addresses NFR-5 of usability,
        as this will help enhance the user experience by allowing them to visualize furniture. It addresses NFR-9 by
        being responsive to the user interactions, such as if they choose to rotate the furniture.</p>

    <hr style="width: 95%; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; justify-content: center; display: flex;">


    <p><strong>4. Embedded Payments</strong></p>

    <p>Design Decision: One benefit of ReHome is that it has the option of embedded payments, allowing users to transfer
        money to each other for a specified listing. The platform will verify a user’s payment method linked to their
        account before allowing them to engage in a transaction. A third-party platform such as Plaid will be used to
        verify this information if it is a bank account. For credit/debit cards, API calls will be used to verify the
        card information.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements Met:</strong></p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Functional:</strong> The main purpose of embedded payments is to support the secure
        payment platform of ReHome. Therefore, the main functional requirement it meets is the FR-4, which addresses
        making secure payments. This design also addresses the sub-requirements of FR-6.2 and FR-7.2. Embedded payment
        systems can help with notifying users of successful transactions, and it can also record a list of payment
        transactions associated with a user.</p>

    <p class="abList"><strong>Non-Functional:</strong> As it is handling sensitive data, embedded payment systems must
        implement strong security measures, addressing NFR-3. This will also meet NFR-8, as having good security will
        increase reliability in the system. It also addresses NFR-2, as the platform should be scalable to be able to
        handle any increases in the number of transactions. Since an in-app embedded payment system simplifies the
        transaction process for users, it increases usability, which relates to NFR-5. As users will be accessing ReHome
        on different devices, the embedded payments system must meet NFR-7 to be designed to work on various devices. In
        addition, this design will help meet NFR-10 as the system can be designed to meet relevant compliance
        regulations.</p>

    <h3>Design Justification</h3>
    <p>
        The decision to adopt a microservices architecture in ReHome is based on the platform's need for modularity and
        scalability. This architecture allows each module, such as the Selling Furniture Service, Buying Furniture
        Service, Messaging Service, and Account Management Service, to function as independent services that communicate
        via APIs. By isolating these functionalities, the platform can scale specific services independently, improving
        performance during high-traffic periods or when processing-intensive modules, like Messaging or Secure Payment,
        need more resources. In the short term, ReHome will deploy these services with API-based communication, and
        eventually, an API gateway will be introduced for streamlined access and authentication across services. Over
        time, a service mesh will further support complex service interactions, enhancing inter-service communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Choosing a relational SQL database for ReHome's data storage requirements offers reliability and ACID
        compliance, especially for modules handling sensitive data, like the Secure Payment and Transaction Feedback
        services. The SQL database structure allows seamless data linking between users, transactions, and listings,
        which is essential for secure data handling and regulatory compliance. Initial database design will focus on
        tables for core modules, such as Selling Furniture, Buying Furniture, and Account Management. As the platform
        scales, data replication and sharding will be introduced for high-availability services like the Buying
        Furniture Service, and a data warehouse may later support analytics across modules such as Transaction Feedback
        and File Complaint Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Virtual Room Placement Service utilizes hand-held augmented reality to enrich the user experience, allowing
        buyers to visualize furniture placement within their own spaces. This AR-based feature aligns with ReHome's
        focus on usability and interactivity, helping users make informed purchasing decisions by providing real-time
        visualizations of items in their intended environment. Initially, the service will support basic resizing and
        rotation of virtual furniture. Over time, more advanced AR features, such as room dimension detection and object
        interaction, will enhance user engagement. In the future, virtual reality features may be introduced to allow
        buyers to experience fully immersive room setups and customize furniture colors and textures to better inform
        purchase decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Embedded payments offer a secure and convenient transaction process within ReHome, facilitated by the Secure
        Payment Service, which is integrated directly into the platform. This module simplifies the user experience by
        enabling seamless in-app payments, reducing friction in the Buying Furniture and Transaction Feedback services.
        In the early stages, third-party providers will handle payment processing, with stringent compliance measures
        like PCI-DSS for secure data handling. Over time, more payment options such as digital wallets will be
        introduced, along with fraud detection analytics to ensure transaction security. This evolution will make
        payments more flexible and secure, further supporting ReHome's goal of providing a reliable and compliant
        marketplace for buying and selling furniture.
