    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        ReHome is a software system designed as an online marketplace for buying and selling used
        furniture, providing a specialized platform to connect local buyers and sellers.
        The system allows sellers to create detailed listings, including photos, descriptions,
        and pricing, making it easy to showcase furniture items. Buyers can browse these listings
        with advanced filtering options, such as location, price range, condition, and furniture type,
        to find exactly what they need. A key feature of ReHome is its emphasis on security and trust,
        offering integrated payment protection and potentially escrow services to ensure safe and
        reliable transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. In addition to the buying and selling process,
        ReHome introduces unique features to improve the user experience, such as a virtual room placement
        tool that allows buyers to visualize how the furniture would look in their home. This system
        addresses the shortcomings of general-purpose platforms by focusing on the specific needs of the
        used furniture market, making it easier, safer, and more efficient for users to buy and sell items.
