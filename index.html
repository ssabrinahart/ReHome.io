    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        ReHome is a software system designed as an online marketplace for buying and selling used
        furniture, providing a specialized platform to connect local buyers and sellers.
        The system allows sellers to create detailed listings, including photos, descriptions,
        and pricing, making it easy to showcase furniture items. Buyers can browse these listings
        with advanced filtering options, such as location, price range, condition, and furniture type,
        to find exactly what they need. A key feature of ReHome is its emphasis on security and trust,
        offering integrated payment protection and potentially escrow services to ensure safe and
        reliable transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. In addition to the buying and selling process,
        ReHome introduces unique features to improve the user experience, such as a virtual room placement
        tool that allows buyers to visualize how the furniture would look in their home. This system
        addresses the shortcomings of general-purpose platforms by focusing on the specific needs of the
        used furniture market, making it easier, safer, and more efficient for users to buy and sell items.

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
        There are 2 main types of intended users for the ReHome platform. One type of user would be the
        sellers who are interested in selling their furniture to others. The second are users who are
        interested in buying used furniture from safe sellers in their area. Below we examine the most
        common usage scenario for each target user.

        <h3>Joey's Fresh Start</h3>
        <p>
            Joey is a senior in his last semester of college. He has been living alone in his apartment
            close to his university for the past 3 years. Joey is planning on moving to a different state
            after graduation for his new job. Since he plans to move so far away from his current city,
            Joey wants to start selling some of the furniture in his apartment before he moves out. He
            needs to be able to do the following using ReHome:
        </p>

        <p>1 - List his furniture for sale on the platform</p>
        <p>2 - Add specific details about his sale to the listing, such as price, furniture measurements,
            photos, and more </p>
        <p>3 - Message potential buyers who are interested in any of his furniture pieces</p>
        <p>4- Be able to vet/get assurance that the buyer he chooses is a real person and not a scammer</p>
        <p>5- Safely complete the sale and have the money transferred over to him securely via the platform</p>

        <p>
            Joey’s ultimate goal is to be able to sell his furniture to real people in his areas without
            fears that potential buyers are scammers who are trying to waste his time.

        <h3>Rachel on a Budget</h3>
        <p>
            Rachel is finishing up her first year at university. She has secured an apartment for the upcoming
            school year and is planning to move in the week after the semester has ended. Rachel is a full
            time student and does not have the money to buy expensive, new furniture. She also does not
            have a car, so she wants to be able to find furniture listings close to her new apartment so
            she can have a friend help carry it over. As a result, she would like to use ReHome to find
            affordable used furniture for her new apartment. Rachel wants a platform that allows her to do
            the following:
        </p>

        <p>1 - Search for furniture for sale on the platform</p>
        <p>2 - Filter for specific details such as the type of furniture, the colors, the price range, and more </p>
        <p>3 - Message potential sellers to ask about the price, when the item will be available for pickup, and
            other purchase details</p>
        <p>4- Be able to vet/get assurance that the seller she chooses is a real person and not a scammer</p>
        <p>5- Safely transfer the money with a cash back guarantee that she can get her money back in the case of a scam</p>

        <p>
            In the end, Rachel hopes to find some good quality furniture pieces from other locals without a
            fear of being scammed by people who claim to have furniture for sale but just end up taking her
            money.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below is an example of how Rachel can search for furniture on ReHome’s interface. She can scroll
            through the listings and select any of them if she chooses for more information.

    <h2>High Level Design</h2>
    <p>
        Our team chose to use a microservice architecture to develop our application. In this design, the business
        logic is separated into microservices that handle different functions within the app. This overall design can
        be separated into tiers.
    </p>
    <div class="imagesCentered">
        <img src="clientDiagram.png" class="diagram">
    </div>
    <p>
        The first tier is the client tier. The client is the frontend layer and will contain the mobile application and
        its user interface. The client will send users requests to the server in the form of API calls and display the
        responses from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second tier is the API. The API will delegate the requests received from the client to the appropriate
        microservice. It will then pass the results of these tasks back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third and final tier is the data tier. This backend layer will contain the database servers that store and
        manage data. Each microservice will have its own private database. The application server will use a relational
        database, like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        ReHome is a useful system for those who want a centralized platform to navigate through the process of buying
        and selling used furniture. Its unique features like a virtual room placement tool and integrated payment
        system make it stand out from other used furniture marketplaces available online. The system takes advantage
        of microservices architecture to split each important function into its own component. This allows ReHome to
        maintain availability during high loads of usage, and ensures it can be scalable over time as the platform
        grows. In the case of one module failing, fault tolerance can ensure the system will remain operational.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to support its unique features, ReHome employs the technique of hand-held augmented reality and embedded
        payment systems. Having hand-held augmented reality allows users to visualize the furniture in their room for
        the Virtual Room Placement Tool. This feature is a game changer for users who are interested in buying a
        product but want to ensure it will be a perfect fit in their room. Unlike many other used furniture platforms,
        ReHome will take advantage of embedded payment systems to allow users the option to pay for their purchase
        within the app itself. This helps simplify the process of purchasing furniture and provides an online receipt
        confirming that the money was safely transferred. Embedded payment systems provide encryption to handle
        sensitive financial data, and they also use API calls to verify valid payment methods, making it a safe choice
        for secure payment transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        By combining these various design decisions, ReHome is able to fulfill its requirements and provide a beneficial
        platform for those who are interested in either buying or selling used furniture to locals in their area.
